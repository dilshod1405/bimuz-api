notes:
  - "Students do NOT have login/registration endpoints as this is not an online learning platform. Students are managed through admin panel or by employees."
  - "All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format (UTC)."
  - "Avatar URLs are absolute URLs when available in request context."
  - "Password validation follows Django's default validators: Minimum length validation, Common password validation, Numeric password validation, User attribute similarity validation."
  - "JWT tokens are stored in memory on the client side. Access tokens should be refreshed before expiration to maintain session."
  - "All file uploads (avatars) should use multipart/form-data content type."
  - "The API uses API versioning (/api/v1/) for backward compatibility when new versions are released."
  - "Booking system implements 10-day rule: Groups that started >= 10 days ago cannot accept new bookings."
